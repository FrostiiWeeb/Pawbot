# PawBot
#### This Project uses the rewrite version of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/) as well as [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) and [Posgresql 12](https://www.postgresql.org/) or higher. Please keep this in mind when using the bot.

## Hosting
If you wish to host the bot, you're on your own for support unfortunately. I try to keep the code updated, but it is mostly to keep the project open sourced, so people know whats going on in the back end. Its not designed for anyone else to run.
